      <p>
        Internationalization is both easy and hard. It isn't hard to add it your
        code, but there is a cost: taking time and effort to implement.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several options for Internationalization:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Do nothing. This is a valid approach that you should seriously
            consider. A significant percentage of the populations of other
            countries speak English.
