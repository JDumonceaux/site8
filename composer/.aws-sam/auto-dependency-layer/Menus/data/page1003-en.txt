      <h2>Defining Corporate Memphis</h2>
      <p>
        Corporate Memphis is a design style recognized for its simplified,
        geometric human figures and objects, often accompanied by bright,
        contrasting colors. These illustrations are less about realism and more
        about conveying ideas and emotions in a straightforward, accessible
        manner. The style is known for its playful yet professional tone, making
        it a go-to choice for tech companies and startups aiming to appear
        approachable and innovative.
      </p>

      <h2>Origins</h2>
      <p>
        The term &quot;Corporate Memphis&quot; is a nod to the Memphis Group, an
        Italian design and architecture group active in the 1980s. The Memphis
        Group was known for its postmodern approach, characterized by bold
        colors, geometric shapes, and asymmetrical compositions. However,
        Corporate Memphis diverges by integrating a corporate-friendly
        aesthetic, aiming for a more sanitized, universally appealing look. This
        style gained momentum in the early 2010s, with tech giants and startups
        adopting it for its friendly and modern appeal.
