<h2>I love this puzzle maker</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.lazels.com/">Lazels</a><//p>
<p>These tiny puzzles are almost jewelry-like.  Made of Titanium, each design has a limited run and are 
quickly snatched up.</p>
<p>"Each puzzle design is a limited release and is sold during a one hour, password protected drop. After the hour is over, that design will never be sold again."</p>
<p>I particularly like this design - where there are interior gaps in the puzzle.  I'm surprised 
traditional cardboard puzzles haven't done this before."</p>
