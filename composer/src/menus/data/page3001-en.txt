<p>Most people have probably never seen this movie or forgotten about it, but I believe it has
one of the most beautiful scenes and beautiful songs in movie history.</p>
<p><em>Toby Maguire</em> as Bud and <em>Reese Witherspoon</em> as Mary Sue 
are pulled from the present age into the monochromatic universe of a 1950s sitcom. 
In this idealized world, everything epitomizes the quintessence of perfection 
and wholesomeness: where married couples sleep in separate beds.</p>
<p>However, the arrival of Bud and Mary Sue gradually ushers in a transformation. 
This picturesque slice of Americana starts to awaken to the realms of art, love, and passion. 
Slowly, the town turns from black and white into a bloom of passionate color.</p>
<p>A pivotal moment in the story, reminiscent of the iconic transition in <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, 
occurs amidst the soulful strains of <em>Etta James'</em> classic, <em>At Last</em>. 
The beauty of this scene is unparalleled. 
The clouds of cherry blossoms, the beautiful lines of a classic car, 
and a quiet glade all evoke a sense of tranquillity and peace.</p> 
<p>The cast includes <em>Jeff Daniels</em> in, what I consider, one of his better roles 
and <em>Don Knotts</em> in his last on-screen peformance.</p>
<p>I also love this movie because it is where I discovered <em>Etta James</em>.  
After hearing <em>At Last</em>, 
I had to delve into learning more about <em>Miss James</em>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was able to see <em>Miss James</em> perform in person 
at the <em>Guthrie Theatre</em> (the original) on March 17, 1989. Although age and life had taken their toll on her, with mobility 
becoming a challenge, her stage presence and voice remained as commanding as ever.</p>
