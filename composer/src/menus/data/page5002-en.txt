<h2>Another puzzle maker that I love.</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.puzzle-lab.com/">The Puzzle Lab</a> in Victoria, British Columbia<//p>
<p>The owners, Tinka Robev and Andrew Azzopardi, design, make, and sell these unique puzzle designs.</p>
<p>The puzzles feature that art of many local artist - who share in the royalties for each piece.</p>
<p>I love that the puzzle edges are often not staight lines.</p>
