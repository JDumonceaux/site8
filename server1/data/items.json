      "description": "The Starry Night is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh, painted in June 1889. It depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village. Widely regarded as Van Gogh's magnum opus, The Starry Night is one of the most recognizable paintings in Western art.",
