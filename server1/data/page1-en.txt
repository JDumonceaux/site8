1. Static Code Analysis
ESLint: A popular tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript/TypeScript code. It helps in maintaining code quality and enforcing coding standards.
Use plugins like eslint-plugin-react for React-specific linting.
Use @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin for TypeScript-specific rules.
TSLint: Although deprecated in favor of ESLint, it was historically used for TypeScript linting. Migrating to ESLint is recommended.
2. Code Complexity Metrics
Halstead Metrics: Measure the complexity of your code using Halstead metrics, which include volume, difficulty, effort, and estimated bugs.
Cyclomatic Complexity: Measure the number of linearly independent paths through the code.
Cognitive Complexity: Measure how difficult the code is to understand.
3. Maintainability Index
Tools like SonarQube provide a maintainability index, which is a measure of how easy it is to maintain the codebase. It considers cyclomatic complexity, lines of code, and Halstead volume.
4. Code Coverage
Jest: A JavaScript testing framework often used with React. It provides code coverage reports, indicating which parts of your code are tested.
nyc (Istanbul): A tool to generate code coverage reports.
5. Type Checking
TypeScript Compiler (tsc): Ensures that type definitions are correctly used and helps catch type-related errors early.
Type Coverage Tools: Tools like tsc can also generate type coverage reports to see how well your code is typed.
6. Dependency Analysis
Depcheck: A tool to identify unused dependencies in your project.
Bundlephobia: Helps you understand the cost of adding a new npm package to your bundle.
7. Code Formatting
Prettier: An opinionated code formatter that helps maintain consistent code style across your codebase.
8. Performance Profiling
React DevTools: Browser extension for inspecting React component hierarchies and profiling performance.
Lighthouse: An open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages, including performance metrics.
