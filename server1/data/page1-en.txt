<h2>What is React?</h2>
<p>React is a front-end JavaScript library framework for building user interfaces based on UI components.</p>
<h3>What does that mean?</h3>
<p>It means that we are building Single Page Applications (SPAâ€™s) that run within the browser. It is not involved in any of the backend (i.e. Service) layers: for that we generally use NodeJS.</p>
