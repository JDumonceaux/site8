Add to global css
<pre><code>
*, *::before, *::after {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
</code></pre>


It simply defines how a box reacts to the border and padding of the elements within it.

By default, the box-sizing property is set to content-box, which means that the width and height of an element only include its padding and border. This can cause unexpected layout problems.

Ensures that the width and height of elements include padding and border, prevents unexpected sizing issues and makes layouts more predictable.
