Use Cases
Integrating Middleware into your application can lead to significant improvements in performance, security, and user experience. Some common scenarios where Middleware is particularly effective include:

Authentication and Authorization: Ensure user identity and check session cookies before granting access to specific pages or API routes.
Server-Side Redirects: Redirect users at the server level based on certain conditions (e.g., locale, user role).
Path Rewriting: Support A/B testing, feature rollouts, or legacy paths by dynamically rewriting paths to API routes or pages based on request properties.
Bot Detection: Protect your resources by detecting and blocking bot traffic.
Logging and Analytics: Capture and analyze request data for insights before processing by the page or API.
Feature Flagging: Enable or disable features dynamically for seamless feature rollouts or testing.


Use the file middleware.ts (or .js) in the root of your project to define Middleware. For example, at the same level as pages or app, or inside src if applicable.

Only one middleware.ts file is supported per project.

<pre><code>
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'
 
// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))
}
 
// See "Matching Paths" below to learn more
export const config = {
  matcher: '/about/:path*',
}
</code></pre>
