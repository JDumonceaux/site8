React comes in many flavors.

<h2>React / ReactJS</h2>
The "original" <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a> (aka React.js or ReactJS) was developed by a software engineer at Meta.  

For a long time, npm create-react-app was the starting point for creating a React SPA (Single Page Application).   This would create all the folders, configs, and initial files for a simple React application.  Nearly all the tutorials on YouTube and elsewhere start with this step.

However, as of Nov. 2023, React recommends <em>against</em> using npm create-react-app.  This creates a version that is very heavy.  

Note: There is a <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/">legacy version of the React documentation</a> that commonly comes up when doing Google searches.  Make sure you use the most current version:  <a href="https://react.dev/">https://react.dev/</a> 

<h2>React Options</h2>
<a href="https://vitejs.dev/">ViteJs</a> is a lightweight, fast framework for React.  I suggest you build at least one site with Vite, then move to NextJs.

<a href="https://nextjs.org/">NextJs</a> is currently a very popular React framework and jobs are in-demand.  I recommend you learn this version.  

<a href="https://remix.run/">Remix</a> is another React framework.

<a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a> is another React framework.

Note:  If you don't have time to learn these other frameworks, you may want to take at least sometime to understand their strengths and their different approaches.

<h2>React Alternatives</h2>
Alternatives to React include:  Angular.js, Backbone.js, Ember.js, Svelte, Vue.js and others.

<h2>React Variants</h2>
There are other "versions" of React for other platforms:
