Node.js is single-threaded.  

Worker threads allow you to offload heavy computations to separate threads, keeping your main thread free to handle user requests.

<pre><code>
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');

const worker = new Worker('./long_calculation.js');

worker.on('message', (result) => {
  console.log('Calculation result:', result);
});

worker.postMessage({ data: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] });

</code></pre>
