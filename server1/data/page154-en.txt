The older way of development is with CommonJS modules  (.cjm).  These are being replaced with <em>ECMAScript Modules (ESM)</em>.

ESM offers a cleaner, more robust approach to modular development with features like top-level await and dynamic imports.

<pre><code>
// math.mjs
export function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

export async function fetchData() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
</code></pre>
