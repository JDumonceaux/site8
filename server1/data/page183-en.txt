1. Reduce the Number of Unique Operators and Operands
Simplify Expressions: Break down complex expressions into simpler ones.
Use Functions and Constants: Reuse functions and constants to avoid duplicating logic and values.
Eliminate Unnecessary Code: Remove code that isn't needed.
2. Improve Readability and Maintainability
Consistent Naming Conventions: Use clear and consistent naming for variables, functions, and classes.
Comment and Document: Add meaningful comments and documentation to explain the purpose and logic of the code.
Refactor Regularly: Periodically refactor code to improve its structure and readability.
3. Simplify Logic
Reduce Nesting: Avoid deep nesting of conditions and loops.
Use Early Returns: Use early returns in functions to handle edge cases and exit early when possible.
Limit Function Size: Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
4. Increase Reusability
Modular Design: Break down the code into reusable modules and components.
Library Functions: Use well-tested library functions instead of writing custom logic for common tasks.
5. Optimize Data Structures
Appropriate Data Structures: Use the most appropriate data structures for the task to simplify the code and reduce complexity.
Encapsulation: Encapsulate data and related operations in classes or modules.
6. Code Reviews and Testing
Peer Reviews: Regularly review code with peers to catch potential issues and get feedback on complexity.
Unit Testing: Write unit tests to ensure that the code works as expected and to catch bugs early.
Automated Testing: Implement automated testing to continuously check for bugs and regressions.
