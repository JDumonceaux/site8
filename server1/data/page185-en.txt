1. Long Function
The Header function is not excessively long, but it includes several inline styled-components. While not a major issue, it could be improved for better readability and separation of concerns.

2. Inconsistent Naming
The naming in the code is consistent and follows common conventions.

3. Comment Smell
There are no comments in the code. While the code is straightforward, a lack of comments could be a problem for more complex components. Adding comments for major sections or complex logic can improve maintainability.

4. Feature Envy
The Header component doesn't seem to exhibit feature envy, where a method or function is more interested in another class than the one it actually is in.

5. Duplicate Code
There's no duplicate code in the Header component.

6. Long Parameter List
The Header component has a short parameter list, which is good. The includeMenu prop is the only parameter.

7. Too Many Responsibilities
The component has a single responsibility: rendering the header. It does not mix unrelated concerns.

8. Obscure Logic
The logic in the Header component is clear and easy to follow.
