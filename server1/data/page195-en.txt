API Composition is providing a single layer, single portal to access APIs.

Often, data comes from multiple systems.  The front-end client should not be required to assemble this data and have information about all these systems.  Instead, we should place an API layer in-between to provide for a consistent, unified view of the data.

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<ul>
<li>Single Catalog</li>
<li>Single Security</li>
<li>Single Endpoint</li>
<li>Data is normalized. Transformed if needed.</li>
<li>Errors are handled</li>
<li>Data can be moved or sourced from alternative systems without impact to the client application.</li>
</ul>

If needed, a NodeJS layer can implement some of this pattern.
