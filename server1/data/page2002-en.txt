<p>These directions are for the Chrome web browser. If you are using another browser for development, 
you can ignore or adjust these directions as needed.</p>
<p>There are two very helpful Chrome extensions that I recommend you install:
<ol>
<li><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi">React Developer Tools</a></li>
<li><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd">Redux DevTools</a></li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>Just Google "Chrome Web Store", then "React".</p>
<br/>
<h2>React Developer Tools</h2>
<p>React Developer Tools adds two tabs the normal Chrome developer tools:  Components and Profiler.</p>
<p>The <em>Components</em> view displays the all the components used to render the page.</p>
<p>The <em>Profiler</em> view can be used for performance analysis.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Redux DevTools</h2>
<p>Redux DevTools can be used to validate the Redux store (if you're using Redux) and has useful tools
to playback state changes.</p>

<br/>
<p>I would also recommend that you sign into Google so bookmarks are backed up.</p>
