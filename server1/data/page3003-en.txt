<p>This memorial is a poignant and sad tribute.</p>
<p>It features 60 bronze shoes, symbolizing the 
tragic fate of around 3,500 individuals (including 800 Jews) 
who were executed in Budapest, Hungary, 
primarily during December 1944 and January 1945.</p>
<p>Since shoes were valuable and could be resold, 
the victims were lined up along the river bank 
and ordered to remove their shoes.  The river carried away the bodies.</p>
