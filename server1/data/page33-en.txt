<h2>Indentation</h2>
Typical indentation is 4 spaces.  At least 1 is required.

<h2>Variables</h2>
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
Variables are created when you assign a value to it:
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"

There is no type specification required.
Types can be changed.
Multiple assignment is allowed:  
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"

<h2>Scope</h2>
Global = created outside a function
Local = created inside a function
# Names can be the same

<h2>Rules for Python variables:</h2>
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

<h2>Casting</h2>
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0


<h2>Comments</h2>
#This is a comment.

Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
Comments can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:

<h2>Print</h2>
print(x)
print(x, y, z)  # Preferred
print(x + y + z)
print(x + y)  # Numbers will be added together.
print(x + y)  # String + Number results in an error.
