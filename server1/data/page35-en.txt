Use npm Outdated to find and update package versions.  

Note: npm Outdated checks both the package.json and package-lock.json.  You should update the package.json and then run npm install to actually update the files under node_modules.

Note:  You should set up GitHub Dependabot to automatically update package versions for you.  This will update only the package.json - not the actual node_modules.  You need to sync your code and run npm install to actually get things updated.
