Although being discussed as a React 19, React Compiler is a separate change that may or may not be released alongside React 19.  The project name for this is "React Forget"

The main impact of the React Complier is to eliminate the manual coding of useEffect, useCallback, useMemo: the compiler will do this analysis for you and ... hopefully ... eliminate unnecessary component re-renders.

Currently, React does not have a compiler stage - so this is a significant change.
