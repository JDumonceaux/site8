Quick answer:  use <em>Types</em>.


Javascript does not have Types and Interfaces, but Typescript does.  

Which one should you use?

<em>Interfaces</em> define a contract - basically what a class needs to implement.

<em>Types</em> are actually <em>Type Aliases</em> - alternative names for Typescript primitive types or combination of types.

Boiled down, <em>Types</em> can do almost everything <em>Interfaces</em> can do and more.  Just to make it easy and consistent, use <em>Types</em>.


<pre><code>
type Animal = {
  species: string
  name: string
  age: number
}


interface Animal {
  species: string
  name: string
  age: number
}
</code></pre>
