<h2>Vite</h2>
Vite is the "engine" that runs the app - it contains all the scripts for how to build and run the application.

The following scripts are automatically added for you:
<pre><code>
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite", // start dev server, aliases: `vite dev`, `vite serve`
    "build": "vite build", // build for production
    "preview": "vite preview" // locally preview production build
  }
}
</code></pre>
npm run dev > starts a local web server with Hot Module Replacement for development, and will automatically change when code changes
npm run build > builds the project, and outputs to the folder ./dist
npm run preview > start a local web server that serves the built solution from ./dist for previewing (run build first)

<h2>Next</h2>
The following scripts are automatically added for you:
<pre><code>
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
  },
</code></pre>
npm run dev > starts local web server
npm run build > builds the project
npm run start > starts the project in production (run build first)
npm run export > export the project as a static HTML - no Node.js server required.

<h2>Create React App</h2>
If you used the traditional "create react app" as a starting point for your application, it uses the react-scripts to "run" the application

The following scripts are automatically added for you:
<pre><code>
 "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
</code></pre>

npm start > starts a webpack development server for local development
npm build > builds and minifies the project for release
npm test > runs any Jest tests in the project
npm eject > "explodes" out the react-scripts - allowing you to customize all details.  
Note: eject is a one-way operation - it cannot be undone.  Save the code to source control first before running this command.
