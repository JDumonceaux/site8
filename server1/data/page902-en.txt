The next version of JavaScript (aka ES2024) is expected around June 2024.  One of the features that I'm excited about is the introduction of Temporal.

<h2>Temporal</h2> 
An ongoing criticism of JavaScript is it's implementation and support for dates and times: it is been inconsistent and a bit lacking in features.  As a result, several third party packages have been developed to fill the space: moment, date-fns, etc.  Temporal aims at bringing this functionality to JavaScript as native features.
