A web site is a non-ending process of maintenance.  The biggest reason is to address security vulnerabilities.  Then, bugs and defects.  Lowest on the list, but equally important to keep the code current: the numerous libraries upon which applications are built continue to change.  

Here are some items to consider:
<ol>
<li>Typescript</li>
  <ol>
     <li>Update the version:  npm install -D typescript    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript>NPM - Typescript</a>.</li>
     <li>Read the release notes: <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript.org</a></li>
     <li>Implement or open work tickets for any deprecated features.</li>
     <li>Refactor code to take advantage of new features.</li>
  </ol>
<li>Lazy Load</li>
  <ol>
     <li>Router Provider - validate Lazy load is used where appropriate</li>
     <li>Chrome | Developer Tools | Sources tab | Page.  Review loaded code and implement Lazy load where appropriate.</li>
     <li>Chrome | Developer Tools | Sources tab | Page.  Remove excess files.</li>
  </ol>
