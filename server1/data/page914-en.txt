Note: This tutorial has a couple of errors.  1) The useTransition hook doesn't accept any parameters - so useTransition({ timeoutMs: 3000 }); would be wrong.  2) The example has the properties reversed - s/b   const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();  3) You should not wrap every input with useTransition - just areas that might take some time.
