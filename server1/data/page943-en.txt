ESLint is an important tool in helping you become a better coder: it can enforce specific standards and help avoid errors.

It is important that you set up ESLint early in your project and continue to review the settings.  If you set it up after you've started coding, you'll undoubtably have a lot technical debt to re-work.   

It is also important to remember that ESLint continues to evolve - especially in it's relationship with Prettier.  Prettier does some linting, but is moving away from this - leaving the linting to ESLint.
